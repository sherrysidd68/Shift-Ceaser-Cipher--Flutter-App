# ciphers
Implementation of Ceaser Cipher Encryption and Decrpytion in pure Dart Flutter Framework.

## Getting Started

The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals.
This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
